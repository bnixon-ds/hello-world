# hello-world
test repo
New to coding and trying to gain a few new skills to make a pivot in careers. Have some skills in Excel use and overall data/experimenting from college. 
Advid love of coffee and college football.
Brushing-up on my Github work. Needing to keep running through the process of this. 
So far, I've made 3 repo's and tied my GitHub to rstudio. Pretty cool.
